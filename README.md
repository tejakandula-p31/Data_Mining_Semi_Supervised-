# Data_Mining_Semi_Supervised-
🧠 Data Mining Project — Credit Card Fraud Detection
📌 Overview

This project applies Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
It analyzes real transaction data (creditcard.csv) and uses various algorithms to identify anomalies or suspicious behavior.

The Jupyter Notebook DataMining.ipynb contains the entire workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
